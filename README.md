# AI Screen Prototype

This project demonstrates a simple prototype for spreading and gathering windows between a monitor and a simulated projector area.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Use the **Spread (⇡)** button or press the **Up arrow** key to move windows from the monitor to the projector. Use **Gather (⇣)** or press the **Down arrow** key to bring them back.

The design uses glassmorphism to mimic a futuristic UI similar to Vision Pro.
